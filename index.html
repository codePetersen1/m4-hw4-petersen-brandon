                <h2>Who is Annie Atkins?</h2>
                <p>
                    Annie Atkins is a graphic designer from Dublin who works in the filmmaking industry. 
                    Most artists create for their work to be seen by everyone. Most of Ms. Atkins work will not be seen
                    be the audience, or seen by anyone at all. Annie states that the quality or "forgery" of her
                    art is still important as it helps to transport the actors and actresses to a different time or place
                    which aids their performance.

                <h2>Cinema Work</h2>
                <p>
                    Annie explains how the process of creating art, designs, and visual props is a type of "forgery."
                    For letters, she uses paper from the same time period and instruments that awere available.
                    Whether the design is for a letter in an envelope that never gets opened, to the hero props like
                    treasure maps or telegrams, the same attention to detail must be made.
                </p>

                    <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
                    <p>Because the famous Mendl's Box prop was done with drawn lettering, a typo in the Wonderstruck
                        "patisserie" was made with two t's. Because it was noticed after the fact, it had to be
                        fixed in post production. Don't ever buy the "authentic" prop on ebay if it is spelled
                        correctly!

                <h2>Book</h2>
                <p>
                    Annie Atkins has written a book "Fake Love Letters, Forged Telegrams, & Prison Escape Maps," 
                    that shows her work and projects, and takes us through the projecess of how she created them. 
                    It is a great read that I highly recommend, especially if you are a fan of graphic design,
                    art, or cinema.
